Using Swift with Spotify API and AlamoFire

Little project I whipped up while learning Swift... shoutout to Archetapp (http://archetapp.com)

Allows user to search for an artist, populates the tableview cells with album artwork and song names for that artist, each cell invokes
a 30-second preview of the song along with a nice album art view and blur background effect.
